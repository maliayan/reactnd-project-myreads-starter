# MyReads: A Book Lending React App

## About this Project

This project was created based on the starter template provided by Udacity instructors. The starter template was static and included HTML/CSS.

I converted this static starter template to an interactive Single Page Application via React.

## Instructions

You can check this project [via this link.](http://maliayan-myreads.surge.sh/)

For local installing and launching the project:

* clone the repository
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## Important Notice about Search Functionality
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
